## Title: How do we make decisions about data and analyses in systematic biology? It depends!

Description: 
When conceiving and developing evolutionary studies, scientists must confront a vast array of difficult questions, such as how to choose among different data types and methods of data collection, and determine which analyses will best address hypotheses. These decisions can affect study outcomes, and often depend upon the scope of the question, the data currently available, and other logistical challenges. In this time of ever-expanding quantities of data and elaborate statistical and computational tools, what is the best way for systematists and evolutionary biologists to make informed decisions about data collection and analysis? The answer we often encounter is “it depends,” which causes confusion among new scientists entering the field or those exploring a new topic in evolutionary biology. The first step towards dispelling this confusion and guiding the future work of systematists is assembling a catalog of benefits and pitfalls of current approaches. This symposium brings together a wide range of experts studying molecular and morphological evolution, paleobiology, and biogeography to discuss practical and theoretical considerations faced when designing and conducting research in each of these fields. Experts will discuss the caveats and assumptions they grapple with when choosing data and methods to apply to a particular question, focusing both on successful approaches as well as setbacks they have encountered throughout the process.
